# Project Summary & Next Steps

We have successfully built a robust, scalable backend for the LEAFCLOUD Hydroponics Monitoring System. This document provides a summary of what has been accomplished and outlines the clear next steps for completing the project.

## What We Have Built

1.  **A Documented FastAPI Server**: A high-performance API server with automatically generated, interactive documentation.

2.  **Structured Data Models**: Using Pydantic, we've defined clear, validated schemas for all API inputs and outputs, ensuring data integrity.

3.  **Persistent Database Storage**: The system is connected to a PostgreSQL database using SQLAlchemy, with a repeatable migration process managed by Alembic.

4.  **Functional API Endpoints**:
    *   `POST /api/v1/readings`: An ingestion endpoint to save new sensor and prediction data to the database.
    *   `GET /api/v1/readings/latest`: An endpoint that retrieves the most recent reading, processes it, and returns a rich object with status and recommendations for the main dashboard.
    *   `GET /api/v1/readings/history`: An endpoint that provides time-series data perfect for populating historical charts.

## Next Steps

With the backend complete and tested, the project can now move forward on three parallel tracks:

1.  **IoT Device Integration**:
    *   The Python script on the Raspberry Pi needs to be finalized.
    *   It should be programmed to collect data from the physical sensors (EC, pH, temperature).
    *   After processing the image with the CNN model to get N, P, and K predictions, it must package all this data into a JSON object.
    *   Finally, it must send this data via an HTTP `POST` request to the `/api/v1/readings` endpoint of the running server.

2.  **Frontend (Flutter App) Integration**:
    *   The Flutter application can now be connected to the live API.
    *   The dashboard screen should call the `GET /api/v1/readings/latest` endpoint to populate its display.
    *   The history/charts screen should call the `GET /api/v1/readings/history` endpoint to draw the graphs.

3.  **Deployment**:
    *   The FastAPI application should be deployed to a cloud service (like Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean) so it is accessible from anywhere on the internet by both the Flutter app and the IoT device.

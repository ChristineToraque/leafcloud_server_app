# Understanding the FastAPI App Instance

Now that we've covered the data models, let's look at the core of the application itself: the `FastAPI` instance.

```python
# From main.py

app = FastAPI(
    title="LEAFCLOUD API",
    description="API for the LEAFCLOUD Hydroponics Monitoring System.",
    version="1.0.0"
)
```

### What is this code doing?

This block of code initializes your web application and configures the metadata for its automatic API documentation.

*   **`app = FastAPI(...)`**: This line creates the central application object. All of your API endpoints (the functions decorated with `@app.get(...)`) are registered with this `app` object.
*   **`title`**: Sets the main title that appears at the top of your interactive API docs (e.g., at the `/docs` URL).
*   **`description`**: Provides a more detailed explanation of what your API does, which also appears in the documentation.
*   **`version`**: Sets the version number for your API. This is crucial for tracking changes and is displayed in the docs.

In short, this block configures the high-level information for your API, making it professional and easy to understand.

# Understanding Pydantic Models: `HistoryResponse`

Finally, let's look at the `HistoryResponse` model. This is the top-level object that structures the entire response for the `/api/v1/readings/history` endpoint.

```python
# From main.py

class HistoryResponse(BaseModel):
    query_range: str
    data_points: List[HistoryDataPoint]
```

### What is this class doing?

This model serves as the main container for the historical data response. It bundles the query information with the resulting data points.

*   **`query_range: str`**: This field simply reflects back the `range` query parameter that was sent in the request (e.g., `"7d"`, `"30d"`). This can be useful for the client to confirm what data it is displaying.
*   **`data_points: List[HistoryDataPoint]`**: This is the core of the response. It's a list (or array in JSON terms) where every single item is an object that **must** conform to the `HistoryDataPoint` model we previously documented. FastAPI validates this entire list, ensuring that the data sent for charting is always well-structured and reliable.

This concludes our tour of the Pydantic models in this project! They provide a robust foundation for building a reliable and well-documented API.

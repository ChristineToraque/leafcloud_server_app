# Understanding Pydantic Models: `PredictionData`

Following our look at `SensorData`, let's examine another crucial Pydantic model from `main.py`: `PredictionData`. This model defines the structure for the output of your machine learning (CNN) model.

```python
# From main.py

class PredictionData(BaseModel):
    n_ppm: float
    p_ppm: float
    k_ppm: float
```

### What is this class doing?

This class acts as a data schema specifically for the nutrient predictions generated by your system. It ensures that the prediction data is always in a consistent and valid format.

1.  **`class PredictionData(BaseModel):`**
    *   Just like our other models, this class inherits from Pydantic's `BaseModel`, giving it automatic validation and serialization capabilities.

2.  **The Attributes (`n_ppm`, `p_ppm`, `k_ppm`)**
    *   These fields represent the core macronutrients for plant health, measured in "parts-per-million" (ppm).
    *   `n_ppm`: The predicted concentration of **Nitrogen (N)**.
    *   `p_ppm`: The predicted concentration of **Phosphorus (P)**.
    *   `k_ppm`: The predicted concentration of **Potassium (K)**.

3.  **The Type Hint (`: float`)**
    *   This rule enforces that each of these values must be a floating-point number (e.g., `139.4`). This prevents incorrect data types from being sent in an API response, making your system more reliable.

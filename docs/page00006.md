# Understanding Pydantic Models: `HistoryDataPoint`

The `HistoryDataPoint` model defines the schema for a single record within a time-series dataset. It's the fundamental building block for the response from the `/api/v1/readings/history` endpoint.

```python
# From main.py

class HistoryDataPoint(BaseModel):
    timestamp: datetime
    n_ppm: float
    p_ppm: float
    k_ppm: float
    ec: float
    ph: float
```

### What is this class doing?

This model gathers the most important historical metrics into a single, compact object. It's specifically designed to be used in a list to create charts and graphs on the front end.

*   **`timestamp: datetime`**: The specific date and time this data point was recorded.
*   **`n_ppm`, `p_ppm`, `k_ppm`**: The predicted nutrient concentrations (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium) at that time.
*   **`ec`, `ph`**: The raw Electrical Conductivity and pH sensor readings at that time.

### How It's Used

This model is used inside the `HistoryResponse` model as a `List`:

`data_points: List[HistoryDataPoint]`

This tells FastAPI that the `data_points` key in the JSON response will be an array, and every object inside that array must conform to the structure of `HistoryDataPoint`. This ensures the data sent to your Flutter app for charting is always consistent and valid.

This concludes our tour of the Pydantic models in this project!
